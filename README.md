# Loss-Distribution-Approach
The repo contains the main topics carried out in [my master's thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349692685_Extreme_Value_Theory_and_copulas_in_the_Loss_Distribution_Approach_A_real_application_to_measure_operational_risk_capital_requirement "Thesis")  on operational risk. In particular, it is described how to implement the so called **Loss Distribution Approach** (LDA), which is considered the state-of-the-art method to compute capital charge among large banks.
